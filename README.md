6. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Key Technical Implementations

### Optimistic UI Updates
The application implements optimistic UI updates across all user interactions, providing immediate feedback while synchronizing with the backend:

```typescript
// Example: Task status updates with optimistic UI
const updateTaskStatus = createAsyncThunk(
  'tasks/updateStatus',
  async ({ taskId, status }, { dispatch }) => {
    // Optimistically update UI
    dispatch(tasksSlice.actions.updateTaskStatus({ taskId, status }));
    
    try {
      // Sync with backend
      await taskService.updateTask(taskId, { status });
    } catch (error) {
      // Revert on failure
      dispatch(tasksSlice.actions.revertTaskStatus({ taskId }));
      throw error;
    }
  }
);
```

### Real-time Data Synchronization
Firebase Firestore integration provides real-time updates across all connected clients:

```typescript
// Real-time task updates
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(
    query(collection(db, 'tasks'), where('boardId', '==', boardId)),
    (snapshot) => {
      const tasks = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
        id: doc.id,
        ...doc.data()
      }));
      dispatch(setTasks(tasks));
    }
  );
  
  return unsubscribe;
}, [boardId]);
```

### Role-Based Access Control
Comprehensive permission system with granular access control:

```typescript
// Permission checking with legacy and modern systems
const hasPermission = (board: Board, userEmail: string, permission: string) => {
  const role = getUserRoleLegacy(board, userEmail);
  return ROLE_PERMISSIONS[role]?.[permission] || false;
};
```

### Advanced State Management
Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient data fetching and caching:

```typescript
// API slice with caching and invalidation
const apiSlice = createApi({
  reducerPath: 'api',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/api/',
    prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
      const token = selectAuthToken(getState());
      if (token) headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
      return headers;
    },
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Task', 'Sprint', 'Board'],
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getTasks: builder.query<Task[], string>({
      query: (boardId) => `boards/${boardId}/tasks`,
      providesTags: ['Task'],
    }),
  }),
});
```
